# Forecast Web API

Welcome to my sample .Net 7 Web API submission.

The `hw` directory is where the web api solution resides.

The `hw.tests` directory contains the test project.

There is a README.md under each directory with additional information.

Please feel free to ask me any questions.

Thank you!
